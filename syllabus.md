# Creative Coding: An Intro to Creative Coding
2 Metro Tech Center Rm 811<br>
6:30 - 9:20pm Tuesday

#### Syllabus is subject to change at any time. Check back regularly.

This course is an introductory programming class, appropriate for students with no programming experience, who are interested in creating interactivity.  Traditionally, introductory programming teaches algorithmic problem-solving, where a sequence of instructions describe the steps necessary to achieve a desired result.  In this course, students are trained to go beyond this sequential thinking - to think concurrently and modularly.  By its end, students are empowered to write and read code for creating interactivity including: event-driven creative applications, interactive installations,  graphical user interfaces, games and user interfaces.  Interactivity will be introduced and discussed throughout.

## IDM Program Objectives
Students will:

* Develop **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities in art and design.
* Develop **technical skills** to realize their ideas.
* Develop **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* Gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.
* Develop **collaboration skills** to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

## Course Objectives
Students will:

* Understand the basics of creative coding in Java & Javascript (Processing/p5.js).
* Write code within the context of visual art + design, to realize unique ideas and to enhance concepts, demonstrating new powers of expression and the incorporation of time.
* Apply their understanding of digital media to software.
* Learn best practices for designing software within an event-driven, object-oriented, real time framework.
* Experiment with different techniques for user input and output, including sensors and non-traditional screens.
* Propose and develop a complete software experience as a final project.

## Course Prerequisites
This class assumes a high degree of computer literacy, but not a high degree of programming ability. We will be learning computer programing in a platform-generic way, however all examples will be demonstrated in Java using Processing and Javascript using the library p5.js (p5js.org).  Having previous coding experience in Javascript, Java, C++, or Python is a big plus, but not necessary.

That said, it's understood that students will be bringing varying degrees of experience to the class. For assignments and projects, a set of objectives will be established, ranked in order of complexity/difficulty. Through a one-on-one assessment of student experience, they will be asked to complete objectives that are appropriate to advancing their skills.

<!--Some students will have experience in programming. Some will not. With the consultation of the student and their experience, the weight of the first two learning objectives will be determined. For example, if you have considerable experience writing code (for example: 2+ semesters, 1 year of professional work), you will be in the PURPLE group, which will pushed to achieve objective #2 with a greater weight than objective #1. If you have a bit of experience programming, but not a lot, you will be pushed to achieve objective 1 with a bit more weight for the first few weeks than objective 2, then objective 1 and 2 equally, etc (the GREEN group). After the third week of this course, this will be determined between the student and the professor on individual basis.-->


## Assessment

Assessment will occur by reviewing the *weekly coding assignments* & *in-class challenges*, *midterm project*, *project milestones*, and *final projects*. The course is cumulative.  Please see the **Grading Section** for specific grade breakdown, **calendar** for due dates, and **assignments** for briefs. Grades will be individually distributed via **Slack Direct Message**. Feedback occurs during class critique as well as on **Slack**<!--your OpenProcessing Sketches-->.

The assignments are your opportunity to put your skills to the test and to challenge yourself to deepen your knowlege and understanding. <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRtV-ugIT0k">Finished is better than perfect.</a> An attempt at them is better than nothing at all. Do not delay submitting your assignments in order to perfect them. Do not delay submitting your assignments by the due date. Deadlines, projects, and work piles up. *Manage your time appropriately.*

Coursework is evaluated according to how well *you* understand and utilize programming concepts to make visual and interactive material. The extent to which you are progressing is assessed on how your submitted work shows advancement within your current path and in the context of the lesson plan. Those with stronger creative skills with little to no coding epxerience will be evaluated based on the development of their coding skills and visa versa.

<!-- For example in the beginning of the semester, someone that is a proficient programming without any visual or creative experience will have more weight of their grade on how much they are pushing themselves to make creative and dynamic visual materials. While those that have no experience in programming, will have a weight distribution between both aspects, ex 50% programming fundamentals and usage of them, 50% creative exploration of visual materials. Later on in the semester, those weight distribution will shift to a 70% creativity exploration and dynamic materials, 30% on programming fundamentals and utilizing programming concepts. This evaluation is made on an individual basis.

As a result, 2 students cannot compare their grades. Each student is at a different point in their development. Each student is looked at individually, with relation to their progress, leaps in development, creativity, exploration, research and risk-taking. If you are unhappy with your grade, you need to be making more effort towards your progress. A "C" grade means average, making average progress. "B" is above average progress and work. "A" means superior work. Period.

Students will evaluate their own progress in a course in three ways: 1) A course evaluation form, which will be developed based on the course’s individual objectives. 2) Students will participate in a self reflection assignment due Week 7 & Week 15 or as otherwise noted. This written evaluation is worth 15 points and to be turned into me as a separate document. 3.) Turning in Tickets to Leave when requested, which will be almost every class period.

* Critically analyze/evaluate how much time was spent learning syntax & structure, programming concepts vs. actually programming, and how does this reflect on the final quality of your end result? 

* Comment on your successes and frustrations with Processing and P5.js.

Week 15 only:  <br>
* Compare and contrast the Object Orientated Programming style versus Procedural Programming style not simply in definition, but rather, YOUR understanding of each as well as your usage/fluidity WITH EACH.
-->


## Course Requirements

* Consult the GitHub account for the class at twice a week for up to date information and demo code
* Consult Slack for feedback regarding your sketches from me and from other classmates
* Come to class on time and be familiar with the current class topics, and be ready to answer or ask questions and participate in discussions
<!--* Submit the weekly Tickets to Leave-->
* Be professional at all times in your communication and attitude
* Give your classmates constructive feedback. Don't be passive in critiques or take it personally. Push everyone's ideas further.
* Complete and submit all assignments by due date
* Acquire and keep up with all of the readings and assigned videos. Read all assigned readings before class. Watch all the videos.
* Devote at a minimum 8 to 12 hours a week OUTSIDE of class, fulfilling homework assignments, readings, watching videos and studying concepts covered in class. Devoting this amount of time, at bare minimum, historically tends to generate an average grade, if not above average.
* Have Desire amounting to Enthusiasm (to Learn and to Explore)
* Have Patience, Persistence, and Discipline
* Be Creative. Experiment
* Pay attention to Detail & Craft
* Have Self-confidence and Pride in your work
* Take Risks & be Fearless in your assignments
* Don’t be afraid to fail. Don’t let your failures determine you. Rise again. Keep moving. If you're not failing, you're not learning!

## Attendance

Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of every class. Class is a community. There is so much technical, conceptual, and design information to absorb, regular attendance is essential. Unexcused absences (without a note from a doctor or agency) will affect your grade. 

Course material missed is your own responsibility to cover, make-up and address. It is not the Professor’s. Office hours are not for making up a class.

* One unexcused absence is allowed; After that, your final overall grade for the course will drop by 2.5 points out of 100 for each additional unexcused absences.
* 3 unexcused absences is grounds for dismissal from the course.
* All presentation and critique days are mandatory.  Being absent on critique days, affects YOUR grade for that project as well as your participation grade. Critiques can not be made up.
* Work is still due on due dates, regardless of whether you are in class or not.
* Contact me in advance if you will not be in class. ([Slack](https://idm-cc.slack.com/) Direct message is preferred). Demonstrate time management, communication and respect.
* Be on time! Lateness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes you are late, your participation grade drops. It's distracting to everyone being late, not to mention disruptive. Please be considerate to the class community and do your best to be on time.
* Material missed is the responsibility of the student to make up. Consult the syllabus. Consult Github for the demo code. Speak to other classmates in order to find out what was lectured and discussed. It is your responsibility to go over that material independently. *Do these things first.* It is your responsibility to contact me if you continue to have difficulty with the information.
* If you have some extenuating need to be outside of class (special doctor's appointment, religious observations, etc etc), please contact Deanna Rayment at (deanna.rayment@nyu.edu, 646.997.3046). They are the Coordinator of Student Advocacy and Compliance.  

## Communication

Slack will be used as the primary means of communication for the class. 

* Direct Message me on Slack for brief questions.
* Talk to me in person first about issues or problems.
 
[Slack](https://idm-cc.slack.com/) Direct Message is the preferred initial contact. Email should be used as a last resort (pds8@nyu.edu). Email is suitable for short questions (to answers that cannot be found in the syllabus), to set up appointments, or to notify me about being late or absent. Emails should not be longer than 5 sentences.

For matters longer than 5 sentences, please email me to make an office hours appointment. This is the proper way to address longer questions, issues, to ask me about an assignment, review a grade you received, or to discuss other matters. If you send me a long email, I am simply going to respond by asking you to meet with me to resolve the matter. I will not resolve matters over email.

## Course Structure
This is a hybrid course - both lecture and studio, both online and on campus. Students will be required to read material and watch videos outside of and before class. Class time will be devoted to questions, demos, in-class peer challenges, critiques and presentations. In addition to the readings and videos, students will be required to complete weekly assignments and demonstrate evidence of work through code uploaded to GitHub. Students will work on individual projects and group collaborations. Guest critics may be present.

The course can be broken down into 3 sections throughout the semester: programming basics, Object Orientated Programming (OOP), and advance topics (automation/behaviors, using addons - JSON, API’s, Arduino, Computer Vision, Sound, etc).

A typical week will aim for the following schedule:

	* 6:30 - 6:45 Class Updates + Questions
	* 6:45 - 8:45 Demo/Lecture/Workshop/Discussion/Pair Programming Challenge
	* 8:45 - 9:10 Show & Tell Presentations
	* 9:10 - 9:20 Weekly Assignments


## Important Aspects of this Course

* **Pair programming** is a popular way to learn and to work on projects. Two people share one computer and write code together. For the second half of class, an exercise will be given which will be worked on in pairs. The exercise will be due at the end of the class period and presented to class. On occasions the deadline will be at another point. Yet, the exercise is meant to be worked on together - on one laptop, in one program. After the first couple of challenges, you will be paired up strategically by me. Each of you will have something to offer and something to gain. 

* **Submitting Homework** will be done via GitHub. It is more important than your resume, whether you are an artist or designer. It’s used largely for software, but can be used for anything, like this class. It’s important to become familiar with it, develop good habits. See the assigned reading links for more information.

* **Time Management and Practice** are everything. You will need to manage your time it to have reasonable accomplishments in this class. The material is cumulative. The readings and videos are essential. Writing code is the only way to make progress and to fully synthesize the material. It becomes evident quite quickly. Develop excellent time management. You will need 8-12 hours outside of class to succeed. 

Some suggested time management tools are [KanBan](https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/what-is-kanban/), [Ink and Volt Planner](https://inkandvolt.com/product/volt-planner/) (also available in undated), the [Pomodoro technique](http://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730), [Self Control](https://selfcontrolapp.com/)

* **Using code found elsewhere** It's super easy to find code online, but **you are required to write your own code for the first 2/3 of the semester**. This will help you grasp and retain the fundamentals. It does help to write the code from the book out, line by line. Code that is not written by you can not be submitted as a homework assignment, project or pair programming challenge as your own work. Period.

If you use code from elsewhere (which you will at times), site the work and author, as well as to comment each line, as to what each line does programmatically. Do *not* summarize several lines of code from a high level (ie, TV Guide or horoscope-style). Comment each line on a granular level. If you do use code from elsewhere, make significant modification specific to your own ideas. Significant modification means beyond variable name and value changes. It's bending these concepts to your idea, especially graphically. It's not a copy and paste job.

*Never more than 40% of your code may be supplied from elsewhere. Period.*

If you use code from online, whether for inspiration, modification or reference, link to it in your comments and credit who wrote it. Otherwise it will be considered as plagiarism, and you will fail the assignment. The code must have a reference, along with URL and be commented LINE BY LINE.

### How to Submit Assignments via GitHub

To do this, you will be utilizing 3 apps: a browser, GitHub desktop and a file browser (Windows Explorer, Finder, Terminal, etc) to complete this entire process.


Do the follow these steps to setup each assignment on Github:

0. Save your work AND all of the necessary support files (index.html, libraries folder, pictures, media, etc) in a folder that is titled in this manner on your computer: *FirstName\_LastName\_Assignment-##*, etc.
1. Go to your Github Repository page in a browser and create a new repo for the assignment, naming it Creative_Coding_Sketch_1
2. Clone that repo to your desktop (it should launch the Github desktop app). Save that folder within a folder on your computer for this class.
3. Using a file browser (Windows Explorer, Finder, etc), take the folder created in step 0 and drop it INSIDE the folder you just created by cloning in step 2.
4. Go back to the GitHub Desktop app. In the summary field, write what additions you have made to your code in summary. In the description, add greater details, notes, and questions for me.
5. Hit the "sync button" in the upper right hand corner. This uploads your code to your repo page on the Github website.
6. Refresh your browser page of your repo. You should now see your code and files up on your repo
7. As you continue to work on this project, save the code on your desktop, in the folder created in step 0, and have since moved to be within the folder created at step 2. After saving each work session's progress, re-visit the Github desktop app to push the changes to your Github repo online. Make sure to fill out the summary and description notes. Do NOT and I repeat, DO NOT, make a new folder within this folder with the weeks editions. IE, you should not have "Week 1 work", "week 2 work", etc. Github tracks your changes and keeps them in history. It's version control! Yay!

## [Research Presentation](research_presentation.md)

You will be assigned a date where you'll be asked to give a [Research Presentation](research_presentation.md). Please research the assigned artist/designers/firms/pieces/collectives in advance. Each presentation will be about 5-7 minutes long. Be able to address the following, along with *3-4 visual examples of each individual or team's work*: 

* What is original/unique about how this artist uses technology? 
* What kind of code did the artist use?  (JavaScript? Flash? Processing? openFrameworks? VVVV?) How are they using the code? What is the code achieving?
* Why is it necessary that the artist use code?  (ie: particularly if it’s non-interactive, could it have been achieved with traditional or linear media?)
* Your presentation must be prepared and professional. DO NOT USE TEXT ON YOUR SLIDES, other than the artist's/designer's/firm's names. Show. the. work. Discuss. the. work.

You will have to make presentations throughout your time here at NYU. Get comfortable with it and get better at it. I will be giving you feedback at times, about your ability to present and how to improve.

If you are fiddling around too much (and it's obvious you haven't tried this out before), I will ask you to sit down and present the following week after you've practiced. It's to respect class time.


## Grading

Category								|	Percentage
---										|---
Participation & Self Assessment	|	15
Assignments & Challenges			|	25
Midterm Project						|	20
RoundTable							|	10
Final Project Milestone				|	5
Final Project							|	25

For each project your grade will be assessed upon the following: *Principles, Creativity/Thoughtfulness, Craft*. Below gives you a sense of the spectrum, giving examples for high, middle and low grades.

Please note: 
A letter grade of "C" is an average grade. Average is not bad. It means average. Most of us are average, in some way. An average level of work is being done. It does not mean perfection. It means that the work still has room to develop at it's current state. It also means that the work has noticeable achievements and evidence of some acquisition of knowledge. I look at the work on an individual basis as well as across the whole class, as to how one is developing. 

Please read examples of each assessment point below to get an idea of my expectations. Note that a "B" is between Satisfactory and Superior.

### Principles:

* Superior - A - Your work shows evidence and understanding of programming concepts discussed in readings, lectures, and exercises, as you bend them to your will.
* Satisfactory - C - Your work shows evidence of concepts and is still developing an understanding of course material. You understand some aspects, but aren’t utilizing them fully. Usage is cursory. Keep pushing your work and review the material to revisit how you can integrate it to your work.
* Unacceptable - D/F - Your work shows some evidence of concepts discussed, but lacks key understanding, confidence, robustness and authority. Aspects are lacking. Reviewing course material is required. Ask questions in class. Manage your time better.

### Creativity, Thoughtfulness:

* Superior - A - Your work demonstrates your personality and a great depth of engagement with the material. It’s extremely evident that you are thinking, exploring, playing and taking risks. You are creating wonderful experiences.
* Satisfactory - C - You are executing your ideas, but more time is needed to consider more deeply about what is conceptually and physically happening. They are barely getting off the ground. Or have large bits that are broken. Do more research and exploring. Play.
* Unacceptable - D/F - Your work is so straightforward that it’s flat. It’s barely coded (or badly broken). It’s copied from elsewhere and not expanded upon. Question and Iterate your work to push your it further. Read. Play. Get off the lame track and get inspired.

### Craft:

* Superior - A - Your work shows delicate care and consideration to presentation and professionalism. You code is neat, clean, commented and structured. Your friends consider you “Type A.” Your style is evident.
* Satisfactory - C - Your work shows the birth of your ideas, but further time and iteration can really push your work to excel. Your code is there, but messy. It can be simplified and made cleaner. What you put into it, is what you get out of it. Practice makes perfect!
* Unacceptable - D/F - Your work is rushed and looks like it was done on your train-ride in or the night before. Make your work something you are proud of. You are here to build your portfolio after all, aren’t you?


## Participation will be based upon: Professionalism, Engagement, and Improvement

### Professionalism:

* Superior - A - Always arrives on time; assignments turned in properly and on time; respectful of others in class and gives feedback appropriately.
* Satisfactory - C - Usually arrives on time; most assignments turned in on time; listens to others.
* Unacceptable - D/F - Often tardy; turns in assignments late; fails to prepare for class; in attentive to instructor or other students

### Engagement:

* Superior - A - Always contributes appropriately to class discussion; frequently offers to demonstrate technique; shows leadership in group projects.
* Satisfactory - C - Usually contributes to class discussion; has demonstrated technique; participates actively in group projects.
* Unacceptable - D/F - Does not participate in class discussion; no evidence of technique; fails to contribute adequately to group projects. 

### Improvement:

* Superior - A - Shows an exceptional and growing understanding of technique; builds on previous lessons; accepts critique and makes proper adjustments.
* Satisfactory - C - Technique is developing; has shown some ability to build on previous lessons; generally able to accept critique.
* Unacceptable - D/F - Little or no development of technique; is unable or unwilling to accept critique; unable to make adjustments.

## Late Work
Unless specified, work is due the BEFORE following class period.

Work that is turned in after class but still on the due date get's 1/3 letter grade deduction. Work that is turned in the same week, get's 2/3 grade deduction. Subsequent submissions get one letter grade deduction for every week that it is late, beyond the first. The lowest possible grade a late assignment will be given, will be an "F". Deductions are calculated AFTER the initial grade is given.

If work is turned in beyond 4 weeks, the work must still meet the requirements for the assignment, or be an attempt in that direction. Work submitted beyond 4 weeks that does not make an attempt to meet the requirements will not be considered and a zero will be given for that assignment.

Assignments that are not submitted will receive a "0". Please realize that a "0" mark is a fantastic way to tank your grade. Getting an F (63%) is far better than getting a zero (0%).

## The numerical breakdown for letter grades is as follows:
Grade	|	Percentage	|	Evaluation
---		|---				|---
**A	:**	|	100-90			|	Excellent
**B:**	|	89-80			|	Very Good/Good
**C:**	|	79-70			|	Satisfactory
**D:**	|	69-63			|	Poor; Below Average
**F:**	|	63 & below	|	Unacceptable

## Technology in the Classroom

Be respectful of class time and activity. Our time together is limited. The experience is better for everyone in the class, if everyone can be present and active. It not only helps you, but it helps your neighbor. Again, we live in a community and we must think beyond our own needs.

[Read Clay Shirky's thoughts on students & laptops in the classroom.](https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368#.ong79i9mw)

## Academic Integrity

Violations of academic integrity are considered to be acts of academic dishonesty and include (but are not limited to) cheating, plagiarizing, fabrication, denying other access to information or material, and facilitating academic dishonesty, and are subject to the policies and procedures noted in the Student Handbook and within the Course Catalog, including the Student Code of Conduct and the Student Judicial System.  Please note that lack of knowledge of citations procedures, for example, is an unacceptable explanation for plagiarism, as is having studied together to produce remarkable similar papers or creative works submitted separately by two students, or recycling work from a previous class.

Please review [NYU's School of Engineering's academic dishonesty policy](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html) in its entirety.  Procedures may include, but are not limited to: failing the assignment, failing the course, going in front of an academic judicial council and possible suspension from school.  Violations will not be tolerated.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA or Chicago Manual style for citing and documenting source material.

This includes copying code for other sources, using code from other sources with only slight modifications and using code from other sources without a reference. See "Important Aspects to This Course" (above) and bullet point number 4 for greater elaboration on definition, requirements and expectations for utilizing code found elsewhere.

##  Educational Accessibility Statement

NYU-Tandon is committed to assuring equal educational opportunity and full participation for all students.  The mission of the Office for Students with Disabilities is to provide individuals with learning differences (a.k.a. disabilities) the same access to programs and activities as other students.  We assist students to maximize their potential while helping them develop and maintain independence.
