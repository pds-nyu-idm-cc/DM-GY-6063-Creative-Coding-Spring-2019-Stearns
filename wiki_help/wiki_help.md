# Cloning the class Wiki

Rather than journaling on our own repository, which seemed super isolated and not conducive to sharing and discussion. We'll be editing the class wiki by creating our own markdown file in its parent directory.

**Reminder:** You must submit a minimum of 2 posts per week. This journal should reflect your progress through the class through your questions, your research, and your arrival at answers (or more questions). What's challenging you, what are you getting right, what is your next goal for learning what you want to learn?

If something's broken, let me know.

## Step 1: Go to the Class Wiki

## Step 3: Clone the Wiki

Paste the link into the repository url field on the URL tab. Double check that you know where the local path is (hint: put it next to the class repo).

## Step 9: Read README.md

Also... download and use MacDown to help you edit .md files. Really, it's a super convenient way to format your posts and you'll get the hang of it in no time.

## Step 10: Create your_journal.md

Migrate (copy paste) your posts from their previous location into this file. You should have been using markdown to format your `.md` files so this shouldn't be an easy transition. Add to the top of this file and treat like a blog page. Here's an [example post](https://github.com/pds-nyu-idm-cc/DM-GY-6063-Creative-Coding-Spring-2019-Stearns/wiki/pstearns_journal).
