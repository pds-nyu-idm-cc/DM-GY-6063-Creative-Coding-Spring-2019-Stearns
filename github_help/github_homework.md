# 2. Make Changes: Add a Folder for Your Projects

1. In your OS, navigate to the folder where you've cloned the repository.
2. Create a new folder at DM-GY-6063-Creative-Coding-Spring-2019-Stearns/student_work/
3. _Please use your **first initial** and **full lastname**_.
4. Example: DM-GY-6063-Creative-Coding-Spring-2019-Stearns/student_work/pstearns
5. Create a **NEW FOLDER** for each assignment, and name it `assignment_01`, `assignment_02`, etc.
6. Drag and Drop the ENTIRE folder containing your Processing sketch for the assignment into this folder.

The path should look something like this example:
